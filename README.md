# 👋 Hi, I'm Raviteja Kunapareddy

Building AI systems that **explain, adapt, and reason** — not just generate.

I specialize in **Semantic AI**, **GenAI Systems**, **Multi-Agent Architectures**, and **Explainable Machine Learning** — with real-world projects that go beyond demos into structured, production-grade designs.
