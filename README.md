# 👋 Hey, I’m Raviteja Kunapareddy

AI Engineer focused on building systems that actually work in the real world — whether it’s fine-tuning LLMs, optimizing retrieval pipelines, or creating multi-agent tools that think before they act.

🎓 Master’s in MIS @ Northern Illinois University  
💼 Former AI Engineer @ TCS (AWS, MLOps, real-time NLP systems)  
🚀 Now building GenAI systems that are usable, safe, and deployable

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Snapshot

```
🧠 AI/ML → TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, LangChain, HuggingFace
🧩 GenAI → RAG, LoRA/QLoRA, Gemini API, CrewAI, LangGraph
⚙️ MLOps  → Docker, FastAPI, Airflow, SageMaker, Streamlit
📊 Data   → Pandas, Spark, SQL, Databricks, Power BI
```

## ✍️ Why I'm Building What I'm Building

Right now, every project I’m working on is part of a bigger goal:

- I’m learning how to fine-tune LLMs (with LoRA/QLoRA) on real data — not toy datasets — so they can actually be useful in finance or healthcare.
- I’m exploring agent frameworks like CrewAI and LangGraph to break problems into smaller, intelligent decisions.
- I'm improving retrieval pipelines — combining FAISS with keyword search — to reduce hallucinations and give more accurate answers.
- And I'm making sure everything I build can be monitored, logged, and controlled — because in high-risk domains, safety isn’t optional.

The goal isn’t just to build “cool AI.”  
It’s to build systems people can trust — and use.
